# Game-of-Life
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life by Nate Stewart. Essentially, choose the number of cells in a grid you wish to be 'alive'. The alive cells will be randomly generated and displayed. Then, choose how many generations you wish to run through until you're satisfied. Quit by typing '-1' or ctrl + C.
